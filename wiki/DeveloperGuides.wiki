*Coding convension*

Stick to the standard Java coding conventions. Can be found [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/ here].

Some exception to the standard conventions:
  * 6.3 Putting all declarations at the beginning of blocks is not always the ideal way. That's a practice from decades ago which is not desired anymore for good reasons (memory allocation, readability). Try to define objects when they are used. An exception could be the return parameters, a definition which really should be up there.

*Coding guide*

  * Use generics if possible instead of working with Object.
  * Use 'static final String' for constants when appropriate.
  * Try to avoid hard-coding class names as strings. Bad for refactoring. If you know the class, just do TheObjectClass.class.getName()


*SVN submit for project members*

This can be done in two ways:
  * Provide a diff patch to be evaluated and approved together with the change description.
  * Provide the list of changes in an email to be evaluate and approved. (might be asked for a diff patch depending on the complexity of the changes).
